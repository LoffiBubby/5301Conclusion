# Week 5 Formal Methods for Information Systems Security

### Ten Deadly Sins of IS Security Management

1. Not realizing that information security is a corporate governance responsibility (the buck stops right at the top).
2. Not realizing that information security is a business issue and not a technical issue.
3. Not realizing the fact that information security governance is a multi-dimensional discipline (information security governance is a complex issue, and there is no silver bullet or single 'off the shelf' solution).
4.Not realizing that an information security plan must be based
on identified risks - Addressing known threats and minimizing losses.
4. Not realizing (and leveraging) the important role of international best practices for information security management.
5. Not realizing (and leveraging) the important role of international best practices for information security management.
6. Not realizing that a corporate information security policy is absolutely essential.
7. Not realizing that information security compliance enforcement and monitoring is absolutely essential.
8. Not realizing the core importance of information security awareness amongst users.
9. Not realizing that a proper information security governance structure (organization) is absolutely essential.
10. Not empowering information security managers with the infrastructure, tools and supporting mechanisms to properly perform their responsibilities - All these going to cost time, effort and money.

### Formal IS Security

- Creating -organisational structures- and processes to ensure information security, i.e. ensure confidentially, integrity, and availability. (Organizations are entities that process infomation with division of labour and add value in the process.)
- Creating and sustaining proper responsibility structures.
- Maintaining -integrity of the roles-.
- Creating adequate -business process-.
- Establishing an overarching information security strategy and policy.

### Four Classes of Formal IS Security

1. Responsibility and authority structures.
2. Security strategy and policy.
3. Business processes.
4. Roles and skills.

Dimensions:

- Organisational buy-in
- Security policy

### Explanation

1. Resoponsibility and Authority Structures

- Determines the performance of the formal control systems
- Provide a means to identify responsible agents
- Understand the underlying patterns of behavior
- Manifest the roles and reporting structures of organisational members.
- Separation of authority and responsibilities
  - E.g. Clark-Wilson Model
  - This ensures that a critical task cannot be carried out by one entity.

2. Security Strategy and Policy

- Determine how administrative aspects of IS security are
managed.
- Establish a security program.
- Assign program management responsibilities.
- Set an organisation-wide computer security purpose and
objectives.
- Establish a basis for policy compliance.

3. Business Process

- Define and identify information flows.
- Establish operational integrity.
- Enable alignment with responsibility and authority structures.
- Enable identification of areas of communication gaps.

4. Roles and Skills

- Identify roles required to match responsibility and authority
structures.
- Identify skill levels required to match the roles.
- Identify mechanisms to attract, train and retain required skills.
